A quiz application I built as a bootcamp student at [Tealeaf Academy](https://gotealeaf.com) (which has rebranded as [Launch School](https://launchschool.com/))

Features:
  - Built on Rails 4 with Ruby 2
  - Utilizes Twitter Bootstrap
  - Uses ajax on the voting feature
  - Uses jQuery on the Exam page to hide the answers
  - Create Exams, add questions and answers, link to relevant documentation, and edit/update them later
  - Tracks the creator of each comment, vote, and Exam
  - Organize Exams by their category. For now it's just Ruby and Rails
  - Comment on Exams and vote on comments
  - Authentication
  - Uses roles to allow admins to edit Exams and Comments if necessary
  - View and edit user profiles
  - Slugged URLs
  - Display time based on users specified time zone

You can still find it [here hosted on Heroku](https://boiling-falls-3365.herokuapp.com/).
