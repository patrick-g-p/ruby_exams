#Ruby Exams#
A personal app I built during my time in [Tealeaf Academy's](http://www.gotealeaf.com/) Rails Course. I wanted to build something that my peers and I could use to review topics for fun. New programmers learning Ruby (and Rails) might find it helpful too!

There's a lot of room for growth, so I'll be updating and adding features periodically.

Features:

    Built on Rails 4 with Ruby 2
    Utilizes Twitter Bootstrap
    Uses ajax on the voting feature
    Uses jQuery on the Exam page to hide the answers
    Create Exams, add questions and answers, link to relevant documentation, and edit/update them later
    Tracks the creator of each comment, vote, and Exam
    Organize Exams by their category. For now it's just Ruby and Rails
    Comment on Exams and vote on comments
    Authentication
    Uses roles to allow admins to edit Exams and Comments if necessary
    View and edit user profiles
    Slugged URLs
    Display time based on users specified time zone
